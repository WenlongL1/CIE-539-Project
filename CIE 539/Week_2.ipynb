    "## Utilizing Library Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing a library, its functions can then be called from your code by prepending the library name to the function name.  For example, to use the '`dot`' function from the '`numpy`' library, you would enter '`numpy.dot`'.  To avoid repeatedly having to type the libary name in your scripts, it is conventional to define a two or three letter abbreviation for each library, e.g. '`numpy`' is usually abbreviated as '`np`'.  This allows us to use '`np.dot`' instead of '`numpy.dot`'.  Similarly, the Pandas library is typically abbreviated as '`pd`'."

    "### Lists vs numpy arrays\n",
    "Lists can have multiple datatypes. For example one element can be a *string* and another can be and *int* and another a *float*. Lists are defined by using the square brackets: \\[ \\], with elements separated by commas, ','.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = ['one', 2, 3.14, 'Last']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists are indexed by position. Remember, in Python, the index starts at *0* and ends at *length(list) - 1*. \n",
    "To retrieve the first element of the list you call:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays  *np.arrays* differ from lists is that the contain only _one_ datatype. For example, all the elements might be *ints* or *strings* or *floats* or *object*s. It is defined by *np.array(object)*, where the input 'object' can be for example a *list* or a *tuple*.    \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_array = np.array([1, 10, 100, 1000])\n",

    "```\n",
    "my_array = np.array((1, 10, 100, 1000))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and numpy arrays differ in their speed and memory efficiency. An intuitive reason for this is that python lists have to store the value of each element and also the type of each element (since the types can differ). Whereas numpy arrays only need to store the type once because it is the same for all the elements in the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do calculations with numpy arrays that can't be done on lists.  \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_array/3\n",
    "```\n",
    "will return a numpy array, with each of the elements divided by 3. Whereas:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list/3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can appened items to the end of lists and numpy arrays, though they have slightly different commands. It is almost of note that lists can append an item 'in place', but numpy arrays cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list.append('new item')\n",
    "np.append(my_array, 5) # Note: a new element must be of the same type as all other elements\n",
