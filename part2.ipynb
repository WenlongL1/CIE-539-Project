    "# Part 2: Cross-Classification to Predict Future Trips\n",
    "    Select attributes for the classification, create data set for the analysis, and identify average number of trips made by each group for 2022. Create future trip production based on assumed modifications of the future households and identify number of trips produced by each zone in the future. For trip attraction, consider the same share as in 2022, with total number of trips same as future production."
